#### Tekkit Classic

The Tekkit Classic server has ops, a whitelist for certain people, and the server.properties. The whitelist is not working because the of the server. I do not know why the server is not doing anything with the whitelist. You will need to modify the files to suit your files to suit your needs. It also has one plugin called ChopTree 2
